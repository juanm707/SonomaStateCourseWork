			<li><p><b>Profile: </b><font color="blue">Radiohead is an English band from Oxfordshire, UK. Their name comes from the [a=Talking Heads] song, "Radio Head", from the "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/master/39386]True Stories[/url]" album. 

Formed by school friends in 1986, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's "[r=767600]". The cathartic "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Creep/master/21481]Creep[/url]", from the debut album "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Pablo-Honey/master/13344]Pablo Honey[/url]" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves. 

Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]'s expressive singing. The album featured the hits "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High & Dry[/url]", "[r=1463625]" and "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]". 

The band's third album, "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990's, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.

"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-King-Of-Limbs/master/311832]The King Of Limbs[/url]" was released in February 2011.
 
Radiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Smiths,+The]The Smiths[/url], [a=Pixies], [a=Magazine], [a=Joy Division], and [a=R.E.M.] (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, refering to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').</font></p></li>
