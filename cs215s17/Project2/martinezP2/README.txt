Title: The Game of Life
Author: Juan Martinez

What works: Everything works properly. Population Size increases and decreases properly.
File input works properly. Still works if file input has 27+ rows or cols.
Random generates 100 cells or less since that is a good number to start with.
Each Cell changes accordingly to its neighbor count. Finishes until no more cells
or a "still" pattern is achieved. 

What doesn't work: So far so good, but maybe an input file can break it if its a huge size.

What is extra special: Nothing is special about this, regular cell game.
