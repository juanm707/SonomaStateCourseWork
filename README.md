# Sonoma State CS Courses

This a list of the courses I took from the CS major @ Sonoma State!

## CS 115 Programming I

An overview of computer organization; arithmetic and logical expressions, decision and iteration, simple I/O; subprograms; principles of good programming style, readability, documentation, structured programming concepts; top-down design and refinements; techniques of debugging and testing. Use of the above concepts will be implemented in a standard high-level programming language.

## CS 210 Introduction to Unix

An introduction to the use of Unix as a programming environment. Communicating with a Unix host, shells and shell commands, files and directories, Gnome desktop, jobs and processes, scripting, programming utilities (compiler, linker, debugger, make, hex dump, etc.).

## CS 215 Programming II

Pointers and dynamic allocation of storage; linked lists; an introduction to the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm; classes and objects; encapsulation; member variables and member functions; inheritance and polymorphism; scoping; templates; iterators; error handling techniques.

## CS 242 Discrete Structures for Computer Science

Coverage of fundamental mathematical concepts blended with their applications in computer science. Topics include sets, functions and relations, Boolean algebra, normal forms, Karnaugh maps and other minimization techniques, predicate logic, formal and informal proof techniques, relational algebra, basic counting techniques, recurrence relations, introduction to graph theory with applications to computer science.

## CS 252 Introduction to Computer Organization

This course looks at the interface between computer hardware and software by introducing computer architecture and low-level programming. Topics to be covered include: data representations, digital logic, combinational and sequential circuits, computer system organization from the machine language point of view, and assembly language implementation of high-level constructs.

## CS 315 Data Structures 

This course introduces the concept of the organization of data into different structures to support the efficient implementation of computer algorithms. The emphasis of the course is on the internal representation of the elementary and intermediate data structures, their time and space requirements, and their applications. A second component of the course is the study of more advanced features of object-oriented programming.

## CS 340 Computer Security and Malware

Current methods for increasing security, protecting the privacy, and guaranteeing degrees of confidentiality of computer records; ensuring computer installation safety; protecting software products; preventing and dealing with crime; value systems, ethics, and human factors affecting the use and misuse of computers. Discussion of recent technical, legal, and sociopolitical issues influencing computer security problems, with an emphasis on malware.

## CS 351 Computer Architecture

Instruction set design; stages of instruction execution, data, and control path design; CISC, RISC, stack architectures; pipelining; program optimization techniques, memory hierarchy: cache models and design issues, virtual memory and secondary storage; I/O interfacing; advanced topics to include some of the following: parallel architectures, DSP or other special-purpose architecture, FPGA, reconfigurable architecture, asynchronous circuit design.

## CS 355 Database Management Systems Design 

This course focuses on the theoretical as well as the practical aspects of modern database systems. Topics include the study of the entity-relationship (E/R) model, relational algebra, data normalization, XML as a semi-structured data model, data integrity, and database administration. Current tools and technology are used to create and manipulate sample databases.

## CS 370 Software Design and Development

This course covers techniques for software design and development. Software lifecycle, requirements, formal specification, metrics, design, functional and structural testing, rapid prototyping, complexity, version control, and team management. Software metrics, tools for component-based software development. Team-based, agile, and scrum methodologies emphasized.

## CS 385 Software Quality Assurance - Selected Topics in Computer Science

This course will cover Software Quality Assurance topics with a focus on software testing.
Topics such as Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing, Load Testing, Performance Testing, Regression Testing, and Test-Driven Development.

## CS 415 Algorithm Analysis

A systematic approach to the design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on efficiency. Topics include algorithms for searching and sorting, hashing, exploring graphs, integer and polynomial arithmetic. Foundations in recurrence relations, combinatorics, probability, and graph theory as used in algorithm analysis are covered. Standard design techniques such as divide-and-conquer, greedy method, dynamic programming, heuristics and probabilistic algorithms along with NP-completeness and approximation algorithms are included.

## CS 450 Operating Systems 

This course covers the fundamental concepts of operating system design and implementation; the study of problems, goals, and methods of concurrent programming; and the fundamentals of systems programming. Topics include resource-management, process and thread scheduling algorithms, interprocess communication, I/O subsystems and device-drivers, memory management including virtual memory, segmentation, and page-replacement policies. These topics will be covered in theory and in practice through the study of the source code of a working operating system.

## CS 454 Theory of Computation

Overview of various kinds of computability, unsolvability, and decidability. The P versus NP problem. Abstract mathematical models of computing devices and language specification systems with focus on regular and context-free languages. Classification of computer-solvable problems.

## CS 460 Programming Languages

A survey of the syntactic, semantic and implementation features of functional, procedural, object-oriented, logic and concurrent programming languages.

## CS 470 Advanced Software Design Project

This course is a project-based course designed to provide a "real world, team oriented" capstone experience for computer science majors. Coursework will be organized around large programming projects. The content of the projects may vary depending on the interests of the instructor and may include industry, government, non-profit organization, or other affiliations.
